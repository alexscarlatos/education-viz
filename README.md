# Investigating Relationships Between Variables of Education and Affluence
In this project, I took World Bank data, ran some statistical analysis on it, and visualized it to investigate how educational variables
are related to national well-being. This was the final project I devloped for my visualization class.
You can read about the details in the report, watch the demo video, or try the software yourself!

To run the app, simply run `python app.py` in the `app` folder. It's built on Flask, and I apologize for the lack of a pip requirements file.

## Some fair notices
- You'll notice some correlations are > 1. This is clearly wrong, so keep in mind the calculations are flawed.
However, as this is a visualization project, you can clearly see many of the relationships in the graphs,
so the calculations don't appear to be 100% misleading.
- MDS stands for Multi-Dimensional Scaling, a technique used to show relative multi-dimensional distance between variables.
- The data points are colored by cluster.
